## 🧠 What is Power BI?

Power BI is Microsoft’s business analytics platform. It helps users turn raw data into interactive dashboards and reports, enabling better business decision-making.

### 🔧 Key Components
- **Power BI Desktop** – Design and build reports on your PC.
- **Power BI Service** – Cloud-based platform to share and collaborate.
- **Power BI Mobile** – Access reports and dashboards on mobile devices.
- **Power BI Gateway** – Bridges on-premises data with Power BI Service.
- **Power BI Report Server** – Host reports on your own infrastructure (on-prem).

## 🔗 Data Sources & Connections

Power BI connects to a wide variety of data sources, including:
- Excel and CSV files
- Databases (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Online services (SharePoint, Salesforce, Google Analytics, Azure)
- Web data and APIs

Use `Home > Get Data` in Power BI Desktop to connect.

## 🧹 Data Preparation (Power Query Editor)

Before analysis, you need to clean and shape your data. Power BI uses **Power Query** for this.

### Common Tasks:
- Remove duplicates, filter rows/columns
- Change data types (text, number, date, etc.)
- Merge or append queries
- Create custom columns using M language
- Handle missing data

> **Tip:** Keep your queries clean and documented with clear step names.

## 📐 Data Modeling

Once your data is clean, define how tables relate to each other using relationships.

### Core Concepts:
- **Relationships:** Connect tables via keys (e.g., `CustomerID` in two tables).
- **Star Schema:** Recommended model with one fact table and multiple dimension tables.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Formula language for custom calculations.

### Common DAX Examples:
- `SUM(Sales[Revenue])`
- `CALCULATE([Total Sales], Region[Country] = "Germany")`
- `IF([Sales] > 1000, "High", "Low")`

> A well-designed model improves performance and accuracy.

Power BI offers a wide range of visuals:
- Bar, line, pie, area, and combo charts
- Maps, gauges, KPI visuals
- Tables and matrix views
- Slicers and filters for interactivity

### Design Best Practices:
- Use clear titles and legends
- Avoid clutter and redundant visuals
- Highlight key metrics and trends
- Group visuals logically using pages and bookmarks
