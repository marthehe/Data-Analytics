# 🧱 Choosing the Right Data Model Framework in Power BI (Intermediate)

Designing the right data model is critical to building efficient, scalable, and maintainable Power BI reports. This guide explores the different modeling frameworks available in Power BI and provides guidance on when and how to use them.

---

## 📊 What is a Data Model in Power BI?

A **data model** in Power BI defines how data tables relate to each other and how they’re structured to support analysis and reporting. It includes:
- Tables and columns
- Relationships
- Measures (DAX)
- Calculated columns and tables
- Metadata (names, descriptions, formatting)

---

## 🔁 Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema

### ⭐ Star Schema (Recommended)
- Central **fact table** surrounded by related **dimension tables**
- Simplifies queries and improves performance
- Easier to understand and maintain

**When to use:**
- Most business reporting scenarios
- When you need fast query performance and clear relationships

### ❄️ Snowflake Schema
- Dimensions are normalized into multiple related tables
- Can reduce data redundancy but increases model complexity

**When to use:**
- Complex, normalized source systems (e.g. ERP/CRM)
- Large data models where redundancy reduction is critical

> ✅ **Best Practice:** Flatten snowflake schemas where possible to improve performance and usability.

## 🧰 Storage Modes in Power BI

Choosing the right storage mode impacts performance and refresh strategy.

### 🧠 Import Mode
- Data is imported and stored in memory (VertiPaq engine)
- Fastest query performance
- Supports complex transformations

**When to use:**
- Small to medium datasets
- High performance required
- Data refresh is acceptable (e.g. daily/hourly)

---

### 🔗 DirectQuery
- Queries data live from the source
- Minimal data is stored in Power BI
- Refresh not needed; always up to date

**When to use:**
- Real-time reporting requirements
- Large datasets not suitable for import
- Strict data security requirements

> ⚠️ Limited DAX functions and slower performance due to source dependency.

---

### 🔁 Composite Model
- Combines Import and DirectQuery in a single model
- Offers flexibility in handling different data sources

**When to use:**
- Need for combining historical (imported) and real-time (live) data
- Balancing performance and freshness

> 💡 Use **dual storage mode** to optimize flexibility and performance.

## 🧠 Choosing the Right Model Strategy

| Scenario | Recommended Framework |
|----------|------------------------|
| Small, fast dashboards | Import Mode + Star Schema |
| Real-time reporting | DirectQuery with efficient indexing |
| Mixed sources and freshness needs | Composite Model with Dual mode |
| Data with multiple hierarchies | Star Schema with flattened dimensions |
| Performance tuning required | Use performance analyzer & optimize model size |

---

## 🧮 DAX Design Considerations

- Use **measures** over **calculated columns** where possible
- Minimize row-level calculations in DAX
- Avoid bi-directional relationships unless necessary
- Use variables in DAX to reduce computation

---

## 🚦 Performance Tips

- Remove unused columns and tables
- Reduce cardinality (number of unique values)
- Optimize column data types (e.g., use integers instead of strings for keys)
- Use aggregations to pre-calculate heavy metrics
- Limit visuals per page and minimize slicers

---

## 🛡️ Security & Maintainability

- Implement **Row-Level Security (RLS)** at the model level
- Document relationships, KPIs, and business logic
- Use **field parameters** for dynamic measures and fields
- Use **certified** and **promoted datasets** for reuse and trust

## ✅ Summary

| Component            | Key Consideration                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Schema Design        | Use star schema for simplicity and speed        |
| Storage Mode         | Choose based on performance vs. freshness       |
| DAX & Calculations   | Optimize for model size and calculation speed   |
| Relationships        | Prefer single direction unless needed           |
| Security             | Use RLS and manage access at dataset level      |
