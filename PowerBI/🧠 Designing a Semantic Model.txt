# 🧠 Designing a Semantic Model in Power BI (Intermediate)

A **semantic model** in Power BI acts as the brain of your report — it defines how data is structured, related, and calculated for users. A well-designed semantic model ensures consistency, performance, and ease of use across reports and dashboards.

---

## 📌 What is a Semantic Model?

A semantic model is a curated layer of logic and metadata that sits between raw data and visual reports. It includes:

- Tables and relationships  
- Business logic (DAX measures and calculated columns)  
- Hierarchies and KPIs  
- Column formatting and naming  
- Security rules (e.g., Row-Level Security)

> ✅ It simplifies the user experience and promotes a **single source of truth**.

## 🔧 Core Components

### 📊 Tables

Organized into **fact** and **dimension** tables:

- **Fact tables** store transactional data (e.g., Sales, Orders)
- **Dimension tables** store descriptive context (e.g., Customers, Products, Dates)

> **Best Practice:** Use a **star schema** layout to simplify relationships and improve performance.

---

### 🔗 Relationships

- Define how tables are connected  
- Use **single-directional** relationships unless bidirectional is necessary  
- Ensure relationships are based on primary keys (no duplicates)

#### 💡 Tips:
- Avoid circular or many-to-many relationships  
- Use bridge tables if necessary

---

### 🧮 DAX Measures

Use DAX to build reusable business logic:

- Aggregations: `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`
- Calculations: profit margin, YoY change
- Time intelligence: YTD, MTD, QTD

#### 💬 Example DAX Measures:
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Profit], [Revenue])

YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
> ✅ Prefer **measures** over **calculated columns** for flexibility and performance.

---

## 📁 Hierarchies

Group related columns into hierarchies for easier navigation and drill-down.

### 🔄 Examples:
- **Date Hierarchy**: Year > Quarter > Month > Day  
- **Geography Hierarchy**: Country > Region > City

---

## ✍️ Formatting & Naming

- Rename fields to be business-friendly  
- Set appropriate formats (e.g., %, currency, decimals)  
- Hide technical or unnecessary columns (e.g., IDs used only for joins)

---

## 🔒 Row-Level Security (RLS)

RLS restricts data access by user identity. You define roles and DAX filters that apply to those roles.

### 🛡️ Example RLS Filter:
```DAX
[Region] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
> Useful for multi-user reports where each user sees only relevant data.

## 🚀 Optimization Tips

| Area           | Optimization Tip                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Tables         | Remove unused columns, reduce column cardinality       |
| DAX            | Use variables, avoid row-based logic                   |
| Relationships  | Prefer single-direction filtering                      |
| Measures       | Use aggregation in DAX instead of visuals              |
| Model Size     | Use proper data types (e.g., integers over strings)    |

> Use **Performance Analyzer** in Power BI Desktop to identify and fix slow visuals.

## 📦 Sharing & Reuse

- Publish your semantic model to Power BI Service as a **dataset**
- Reuse the dataset across multiple reports (**thin reports**)
- Promote or certify trusted datasets for team-wide usage

> Promotes consistency and avoids duplicated work across reports and teams.
